			"title": "Taste Coffee - Treviso, Italy",
			"content_html": "<p>If you consider coffee as your hobby, chances are that you've heard of James Hoffmann, one of the most famous Coffee Youtubers of all-time. Some time ago he released a video series on the Tiramisu:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWMbuTc7iIU?si=sVvJ-40MaNd4bvbV\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p>Though several contending theories exist, Le Beccherie of Treviso, Italy is considered the birthplace of tiramisu. I've always wondered what that tiramisu tasted like. Fortunately, in a recent visit to Italy, I had a chance to find out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/nxqedEU76XP8YqGbA\"><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/UABAtXcprI-300.avif 300w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/UABAtXcprI-300.webp 300w\"><img alt=\"The tiramisu at Le Beccherie.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/UABAtXcprI-300.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\"></picture></a></p>\n<p>In summary, it was good, classic, and predictable. My expectations were conservative having watched James Hoffmann's video, and it was met squarely where I had set it.</p>\n<p>Treviso is a bit out of the way as a destination, so I had done some research beforehand for any specialty coffee shops nearby as a second stop. And there was a perfect one, just a minute walk around the corner from Le Beccherie.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/YePgvt783KHSg1jMA\"><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/n4n2sdux5Q-600.avif 600w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/n4n2sdux5Q-600.webp 600w\"><img alt=\"The coffee and tiramisu at Taste Coffee.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://yotsugi.io/img/n4n2sdux5Q-600.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></picture></a></p>\n<p>Taste Coffee. You've probably never heard of it, but it is not to be missed if you are ever in Treviso. The coffee selection is amazing; if memory serves, I tried a washed Kenyan, and a &quot;thermo shock&quot; washed bourbon from Finca Las Flores, Colombia. The Kenyan offered the trademark tomato/currant savory characteristics, whereas the Colombian had a powerfully fruit-punchy sweetnes and acidity - both by recommendation from the kind and skillful barista, Elisa. The coffee was carefully brewed and purposefully served into different vessels: the Kenyan in the glass, to let the savory notes come out in the cooled cup; and the Colombian in the ceramic, to enjoy the layers of different aromas as the temperature cooled. Elisa, as it turns out, is an absolute star: she is the 2019 Champion for the Italian AeroPress Championships, and the 2020 Champion for the Italian Brewers Cup. Truly, it was a privilege.</p>\n<p>After the coffee, I turned my attention to their tiramisu, and it was the icing (coffee?) on the cake. The sponge, lightly soaked with intense espresso flavor, and the boldly sweet and creamy mascarpone, created the perfect balance and contrast. It was an unforgettable tiramisu experience.</p>\n",
